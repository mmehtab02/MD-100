TRADITIONAL IMAGING DEPLOYMENTS - CONCEPT OF IMAGING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BUT HAS CHANGED A LOT OVER THE YEARS. THE VERSION OF IMAGING USED IN W10 NOW HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE WINDOWS VISTA (QUITE A WHILE) NEW FEATURES ETC. BUT PRETTY MUCH SAME.

NEED A WAY OF CAPTURING AN EXISTING COMPUTERS CONFIGURATION SETTINGS AND FILES AND GETTING IT ONTO A NEW COMPUTER. THINK 50 COMPUTERS TO BE INSTALLED, NOT OPTIMAL WITH SINGLE DVDS.


1 OPTION : SET UP ONE COMPUTER WITH W10 AND CONFIGURE ALL SOFTWARE NEEDED AND CAPTURE AN IMAGE OF THAT COMPUTER (INSIDE SALES COMPUTER, REFERENCE COMPUTER) AND 50 OTHER COMPUTERS ARE OUTSIDE SALES COMPUTERS.

REF COMP - HAS EVERYTHING NEEDED, W10, UPDATES, CONFIGS, JOINED ON DOMAIN, VIRUS SPYWARE PROTECTION, OFFICE INSTALLED ETC. - NEED TO REPLICATE THIS SETUP TO THE NEW MACHINES.


MICROSOFT SAYS SET UP A SERVER (W SERVER 2019 FOR EXAMPLE) AND INSTALL A SERVICE ON THIS MACHINE CALLED WDS (WINDOWS DEPLOYMENT SERVICES). THIS SERVER ACTS AS IMAGING SERVER. ALSO INSTALL MDT ON THIS.


CAN INSTALL MDT ON A W10 COMPUTER IF YOU WANT, BUT YOU CAN PUT ON WDS SERVER COMPUTER AS CENTRAL MANAGER FOR IMAGING.

ALSO HAVE SERVICE THAT COMES WITH WDS - PXE (PREBOOT EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT) - CHANCES ARE IF YOU PURCHASES A NETWORK ADAPTER CARD OR COMPUTERS THAT HAVE A NAC (NORMALLY THE CASE), THAT NAC SUPPORTS PXE. PCE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR LONG TIME AND NACS HAVE BEEN COMING WITH IT.


PXE ALLOWS A COMPUTER TO BOOT UP ACROSS THE NETWORK EVEN WITHOUT AN EXISTING OS. THE COMPUTER CAN BOOT UP AND USING THE UEFI BIOS SETTINGS OF THE BOOT PHASE OF THE COMPUTER IT CAN BOOT OFF NAC AND CAN LOCATE THE PXE SERVICE WHICH PLAYS A ROLE IN IMAGING.

AN INSTALLED VERSION OF W10 IS ALREADY AN IMAGED COMPUTER. EVERYTHING IS AN IMAGE - EVER SINCE VISTA CAME OUT, EVERY OS OF WINDOWS IS AN IMAGE. IN FACT YOU HAVE A FILE ON THE WINDOWS DVD THAT’S CALLED THE INSTALL.WIM FILE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AN IMAGE.

THE REFERENCE / INSIDE SALES COMPUTER IS CALLED AN ONLINE IMAGE. IF YOU SHUT THE COMPUTER DOWN IT STILL IS AN ONLINE IMAGE. A VERSION OF WINDOWS THAT IS INSTALLED IS AN ONLINE IMAGE WHETHER IT’S BOOTED UP OR NOT.

NEED WAY TO CAPTURE THIS IMAGE AND STORE IT ON THE WDS IMAGE SERVER. WE CAN USE THE WINDOWS PE (PREINSTALLATION ENVIRONMENT). THE TRICK IS YOU HAVE TO GET THE WINDOWS PE RUNNING UP ON THE REFERENCE COMPUTER. YOU CAN DO THAT BY PXE. BOOT UP COMPUTER USING PXE MODE WHICH WILL BOOT UP AND FIND THE PXE SERVICE ON SERVER WHICH THIS SERVICE WILL DOWNLOAD WINDOWS PE IN THE MEMORY ON THIS REFERENCE COMPUTER AND YOU CAN CAPTURE THE IMAGE.


ANOTHER WAY - HAVE PE ON A DVD / CD. ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN GET WINDOWS PE ON USB DRIVE - WINDOWS PE IS FREE DOWNLOAD ON MICROSOFT WEBSITE.


WINDOWS PE COMES WITH TOOL CALLED DISM.EXE (OLDER TOOL CALLED IMAGEEX) - USE THAT TOOL/COMMAND TO CAPTURE THE IMAGE AND STORE ON THE SERVER.


NOW WE HAVE IMAGE FILE ON SERVER (SALES.WIM NAME) - THIS IS AN OFFLINE IMAGE FILE. OFFLINE IMAGE IS AN IMAGE THAT IS STORED IN A WIM FILE.


INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH YOU WILL FIND EVERY IMAGE INSIDE THE IMAGE FILE HAS TO HAVE A NAME AND AN INDEX NUMBER.

SALES.WIM - NAME (INSIDE SALES), INDEX (1) - WHY? YOU CAN STORE MORE THAN ONE IMAGE INSIDE AN IMAGE FILE.


COPY REFERENCE COMPUTER, NOW IT’S OUTSIDE SALES COMPUTER (SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT), CAPTURE THAT IMAGE SAME WAY AS FIRST IMAGE.


THIS TIME STORE INSIDE IMAGE FILE SALES.WIM AND NAME AS OUTSIDE SALES WITH INDEX 2 FOR EXAMPLE. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?


WHEN WE GO TO DEPLOY IMAGE DOWN TO THE 50 COMPUTERS FROM THE WDS SERVER, CAN CHOOSE WHICH IMAGE GETS DEPLOYED. 25 INSIDE SALES, 25 OUTSIDE SALES.

DEPLOYING IMAGE WORKS SAME WAY - WINDOWS PE, DISM.EXE




THIS IS CALLED THE LITE TOUCH INSTALLATION
____________________________________________________

CAN ALSO ACHEIVE ZERO TOUCH IF YOUR COMPANY SETS UP SCCM SERVER. SCCM SUPPORTS A FEATURE CALLED WAKE ON LAN. IT WILL ALSO USE SOME OF THE MDT TASK SEQUENCES ETC. AND CAN AUTOMATE THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF CAPTURING AND DEPLOYMENT.


WITH SCCM HAVE THE COMPUTERS WAKE UP, AND TELL THEM TO GET THE IMAGE FROM THE WDS SERVER, WHICH IMAGE TO GET, AUTOMATE THE ENTIRE PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH. EX : START AND SCHEDULE ON FRIDAY, COME BACK ON MONDAY, 50 NEW COMPUTERS SET UP FOR YOU WITH SCCM. WITH THAT YOU NEED DEPLOYMENT SERVICES AND MDT AND SCCM IS THE CRITICAL PART. SCCM IS NOT FREE.
