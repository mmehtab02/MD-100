WINDOWS AUTOPILOT - CLOUD BASED FEATURE. NOT REALLY DEPLOYING AN IMAGE.

PURCHASE A BUNCH OF COMPUTERS FROM AN OEM (DELL, ETC), IF YOU KNOW THE HARDWARE / DEVICE ID OF COMPUTER, ASSOCIATE IT WITH MICROSOFT CLOUD SERVICE AND AUTOPILOT CAN INSTALL AND CONFIGURE THINGS ON THAT MACHINE.

WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU PUT MACHINES IN PLACE, TURN THEM ON, AUTO CONNECT TO CLOUD WITH INTERNET, OUT OF BOX EXPERIENCE GETS CONTROLLED BY AUTOPILOT AND JOINED INTO CLOUD AND SOFTWARE IS DEPLOYED VIA THIS THING CALLED IN TUNE DOWN TO THOSE MACHINES. UPDATES, APPLICATIONS, CONFIG SETTINGS, ETC.

THIS IS CONSIDERED A MODERN APPROACH TO DEPLOYMENT AND USES CLOUD. VS. IMAGING AND FRESH INSTALL IS A TRADITIONAL APPROACH.
