WHEN YOU BACKUP YOUR USER’S INFORMATION, IT BACKS UP ALL THE USER PROFILES ON THE MACHINE.

IF YOU WANT TO SPECIFY WHICH USERS ON THE MACHINE YOU WANT TO BACKUP?

SCENARIO → COMPUTER IN COMPANY 6-7 YEARS, ONE MAIN PERSON THAT SAT THERE, OVER THE YEARS 20 PEOPLE HAVE LOGGED INTO IT AT ONE POINT OR THE OTHER, YOU DON’T WANT TO BACK ALL THEIR STUFF UP.

/ui:<DomainName>\<UserName>
/ui:<ComputerName>\<LocalUserName>

ALSO HAVE ABILITY TO USE EXCLUDE OPTION (EXCLUDE SPECIFIC USERS)

CAN BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT YOU BACKUP OR NOT BACKUP

SID - UNIQUE IDENTIFIER / SOCIAL SECURITY FOR A USER EVEN IF IT CHANGES. PERMISSIONS USE SID.

STILL BACKING UP…

GOOGLE → LOADSTATE → LOADSTATE SYNTAX ON MICROSOFT

THIS IS TO RESTORE USER PROFILE INFORMATION.

SYNTAX IS VERY SIMILAR.

DONE ON THE DESTINATION COMPUTER. (SCAN STATE TO BACK STUFF UP AND LOAD STATE ON DESTINATION COMPUTER)

SIMILAR COMMAND AND SYNTAX

COUPLE SWITCHES TO POINT OUT :

/hardlink (hard link migration, use hard link switch on restoration)

/i

/config    (config.xml)

/ui       (restore specific user)

/lac    (if this was for a local user account and not a domain user account that you were restoring, you want to add this /lac:[Password] switch. This would create a local account. The problem would be if you were restoring this user back to a computer that was not part of the domain (this was all done locally) you wouldn’t have an account that it would associate it with like you would in a domain)
(THIS LOCAL ACCOUNT CREATE WOULD CREATE A LOCAL ACCOUNT, ASSIGN IT A PASSWORD, AND NOW YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH A PROFILE TO GO WITH)

REMEMBER /lae SWITCH TO GO WITH THIS. - WHEN YOU CREATE THE ACCOUNT AND GIVE IT A PASSWORD, IT IS A DISABLED ACCOUNT. THIS ENABLES IT.

EVEN IF YOU FORGET TO DO THIS, YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR LOCAL USER TOOLS AND ENABLE THAT ACCOUNT IF YOU NEEDED TO.

STILL BACKING UP…

C: DRIVE → BACKUP → USMT (FOLDER)

FOLDER COULD BE STORED ON A FLASH DRIVE, EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE, ACROSS THE NETWORK, ETC. OPTIONS TO BACK UP.

GO TO DESTINATION COMPUTER ONCE IT’S DONE BACKING UP AND DO A LOAD STATE COMMAND FOR THE RESTORATION.
_________________________

PROCESS : SCANSTATE → BACK IT UP TO MEDIA CHOICE → NEW COMPUTER SETUP WITH NEW OS → DO LOAD STATE AFTER THAT.

WITH SCCM AND MDT YOU CAN AUTOMATE A LOT OF THIS (SCRIPTS, MDT TASK SEQUENCES).
