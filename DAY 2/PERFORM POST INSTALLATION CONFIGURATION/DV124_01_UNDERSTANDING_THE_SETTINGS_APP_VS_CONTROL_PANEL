LOOK AT SOME OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO CONFIGURE OUR COPY OF W10.

MICROSOFT PUSHED THE FACT THAT THEY WANT W10 TO FEEL LIKE A MOBILE OS.

THE LOGIC → SMART PHONE, GET USED TO SMARTPHONE, UTILIZE APPS AND SETTINGS, COG SYMBOL (SETTINGS), CONFIGURE DIFFERENT SETTINGS.

MICROSOFT WANTED TO CREATE THAT SAME TYPE OF EXPERIENCE IN THEIR OS.

START → SETTINGS → ALL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

GOAL WAS TO MAKE IT INTUITIVE AND TOUCH SCREEN FRIENDLY.

TABLET MODE IN W10 CHANGES LOOK AND FEEL OF OS TO LOOK LIKE A TABLET.

CONSIDER THIS EASIER TO NAVIGATE AND CLEANER SYSTEM VS. CONTROL PANEL.

WHAT YOU FIND IS WE ACTUALLY STILL HAVE OLD WAY → CONTROL PANEL.

NOW MADE IT HARDER TO REACH CONTROL PANEL BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU TO USE THE SETTINGS APP.

SEARCH → CONTROL PANEL.

CATEGORY VIEW (LACK OF ICONS)

LARGE ICONS (ALL ICONS)

MICROSOFT HAS BEEN SLOWLY MOVING ALL THE SETTINGS INTO THE SETTINGS APP.

IN SOME CASES, CONTROL PANEL REDIRECTS TO SETTINGS APP.

IN SOME CASES, SOME THINGS GOT COMPLETELY REMOVED.

IN SOME CASES, YOU GO INTO SETTINGS APP, GET REDIRECTED TO CONTROL PANEL.

SETTINGS → SYSTEM → POWER & SLEEP → ADDITIONAL POWER SETTINGS (REDIRECTED TO CONTROL PANEL)

NOT EVERYTHING IS MOVED OUT YET, REDIRECTION HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

GET FAMILIAR WITH SETTINGS APP AS TIME GOES ON.
